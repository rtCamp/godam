# Layers Manager Components

This directory contains the refactored components of the LayersManager class, split into focused, maintainable modules.

## Structure

- **`LayerValidator.js`** - Handles layer dependency checking and validation logic
- **`FormLayerManager.js`** - Manages form layer functionality including skip buttons, form observation, and time-based updates
- **`HotspotLayerManager.js`** - Manages hotspot layer functionality including creation, positioning, tooltip management, and interactions
- **`../layersManager.js`** - Main orchestrator that coordinates the above components

## Benefits of this refactoring

1. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each module has a clear, focused purpose
2. **Better Maintainability**: Smaller files are easier to understand and modify
3. **Improved Testability**: Individual components can be tested in isolation
4. **Enhanced Reusability**: Components can potentially be reused in other contexts
5. **Reduced Complexity**: The original 713-line file is now split into manageable chunks

## Public Interface

The main `LayersManager` class maintains the same public interface to ensure backward compatibility with existing code that depends on it.
